Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data assignment

This script merges pre-downloaded and exported data from the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Assignmet and produces two datasets:
* tidy datasets of mean and standard deviation measurements
* tidy summary dataset grouped by subjects and activities

The script needs dplyr package to be installed in advance.
